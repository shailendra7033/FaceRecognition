## Description
    This is console project that is used for marking attendance of students. 
    I have used PYTHON as language because Machine learning and computer vision model get easier in this language.
    I have also used opencv , numpy and haar-cascade for face recognition. 
    i had used concept of file handling for writing attendance of student into text file.

## How face recognition works
      
   #### face detection
   #### training the model for face detection
   #### finally identifying with whom the given face matches
